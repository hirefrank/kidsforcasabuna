Kids for Casa Buna is a youth-led nonprofit bridging New York City and Bucharest to transform young lives across Romania. Founded by siblings Eric, Ecaterina, and Noah Thomas, we champion a unique approach: empowering kids to help other kids.

## Our Story

The Thomas siblings' connection to Romania runs deep. Each summer, they immerse themselves in Bucharest's vibrant culture, working directly with local children through development programs, educational initiatives, and summer camps. This hands-on experience sparked their vision: a charity designed by youth, for youth.

## Our Mission

We partner with [Casa Buna Charity in Bucharest](https://asociatiacasabuna.ro/) to provide vital resources to vulnerable children while fostering global youth leadership. Through our programs, young people across the United States engage in meaningful fundraising and cultural exchange with their Romanian peers.

## Join Our Journey

Together, we're building a future where every child has access to the resources and opportunities they deserve. Your support strengthens this bridge between young leaders and the communities they serve.
