We made this program because our friend, Valeriu is in charge of Casa Buna; and I like Valeriu and Hannah a lot (Hannah is his wife)! 

Casa Buna is the place where Roma kids who have a hard time at home come and have some fun but also learn to read and write! 

Instead of getting gifts for our birthdays, we raise the money we all get from our birthday parties and donate it to Casa Buna.

Also, when you accomplish your goal of how much money to donate to Casa Buna, you feel AMAZING!!! My favorite thing to do Is to get together with the kids once a year and we all speak and have fun by the beach near the Black Sea! 

The newest member in kids for Casa Buna is Lia, our 1 month old sister. I know we’ve only been talking mostly about money, but its not all about that. It's also all the joy it brings to us. 

It’s really cool every time we see them, to know that we helped sponsor a few days of camp with the $$$ we raised for them. Cool, right? My family is the #1 FAN of Casa Buna.

So, in conclusion, go Casa Buna!!!!!!
